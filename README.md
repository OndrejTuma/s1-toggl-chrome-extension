# s1-toggl-chrome-extension
Chrome extension for integration toggl api into redmine.

Now it also plays with [s1 microservice](https://github.com/Rootre/git-projects) to control 
local git via this extension

### TODO

- [x] fix redmine regex so double slashes pass the check (happens many times)
- [ ] allow administration of (project - working dir) pairs
